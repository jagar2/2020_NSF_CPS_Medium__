%BROADENING PARTICIPATION IN COMPUTING
%
%CISE has long been committed to Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC). The underrepresentation of many groups—including women, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Native Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities—in computing deprives large segments of the population of the opportunity to be creators of technology and not only consumers. Ending underrepresentation will require a range of measures, including institutional programs and activities as well as culture change across colleges, departments, classes, and research groups.
%
%With this solicitation, CISE is continuing a pilot effort started in 2018 encouraging the research community to engage in meaningful BPC activities. This activity builds on many of the programs, research, and resources created through CISE's past and ongoing investments in BPC, and it aligns with the recommendations of the Strategic Plan for Broadening Participation produced by the CISE Advisory Committee in 2012. Specifically:
%
%Each Medium and Large project must, by the time of award, have in place an approved BPC plan. In this ongoing pilot phase, CISE will work with each PI team following merit review and prior to making an award to ensure that plans are meaningful and include concrete metrics for success. CISE will also provide opportunities for PIs to share BPC experiences and innovations through program PI meetings. PIs of Medium and Large proposals are therefore strongly encouraged consider this eventual requirement as they develop their proposals and include one- to three-page descriptions of their planned BPC activities under Supplementary Documents in their submissions. Feedback will be provided on such plans.
%
%PIs submitting to the Small size class should note that CISE intends to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of the above approach for Medium and Large projects and determine appropriate next steps, including potential further expansion of this effort in future years. PIs of Small projects are therefore strongly encouraged to include plans for BPC activities within the Project Description sections of their proposals. Feedback will be provided on these plans.
%
%A strong BPC plan addresses at least the following five elements: (1) the context of the proposed activity, (2) intended target population(s), (3) plan of activities, (4) prior experience (if any) and/or intended preparation/training activities, and (5) plans for the measurement and dissemination of outcomes. All collaborators are expected to participate in BPC activities. More information, including metrics for BPC activities and examples, can be found at: https://www.nsf.gov/cise/bpc/.
