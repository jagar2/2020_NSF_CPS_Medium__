\section{Results from Prior NSF Support}

\myparagraph{Seda Memik:} CCF-1422489:HF:Small:Thermal Monitoring in 3D Integrated Circuits, \$450,000, 7/15/2014-6/30/2018; 
{\bf Intellectual Merit:} A thin film bimetallic thermocouple technology for temperature sensing, including fabrication methods and chip integration is developed. {\bf Broader Impact:} Detailed real-time thermal mapping will allow significant improvements in dynamic monitoring for energy-efficient computers with greater computational power. This will benefit the sustainability of future computing systems. This project has resulted in a Ph.D. thesis~\cite{daweiThesis}, a book~\cite{Memik2016HeatMI}, and publications~\cite{LiTVLSI,LiDAC2017,LiISCAS}.
