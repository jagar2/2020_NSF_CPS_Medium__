	Abstract = {The ability to manipulate domains underpins function in applications of ferroelectrics. While there have been demonstrations of controlled nanoscale manipulation of domain structures to drive emergent properties, such approaches lack an internal feedback loop required for automatic manipulation. Here, using a deep sequence-to-sequence autoencoder we automate the extraction of latent features of nanoscale ferroelectric switching from piezoresponse force spectroscopy of tensile-strained PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 with a hierarchical domain structure. We identify characteristic behavior in the piezoresponse and cantilever resonance hysteresis loops, which allows for the classification and quantification of nanoscale-switching mechanisms. Specifically, we identify elastic hardening events which are associated with the nucleation and growth of charged domain walls. This work demonstrates the efficacy of unsupervised neural networks in learning features of a material's physical response from nanoscale multichannel hyperspectral imagery and provides new capabilities in leveraging in operando spectroscopies that could enable the automated manipulation of nanoscale structures in materials.},

              materials, enabling a plethora of applications and captivating
              the attention of the scientific community for over half a
              century. Many previous studies considered ferroelectric switching
              as a purely physical process, whereas polarization is fully
              controlled by the superposition of electric fields. However,
              screening charge is required for thermodynamic stability of the
              single domain state that is of interest in many technological
              applications. The screening process has always been assumed to be
              fast; thus, the rate-limiting phenomena were believed to be
              domain nucleation and domain wall dynamics. In this manuscript,
              we demonstrate that polarization switching under an atomic force
              microscopy tip leads to reversible ionic motion in the top 3 nm
              of PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 surface layer. This evidence points to a strong
              chemical component to a process believed to be purely physical

               the figures of merit for applications of pyroelectric materials

               to achieve large field-driven responses is a hallmark of
               functional materials, but routes to such competition are
               limited. Here, a new route to such effects involving
               domain-structure competition is demonstrated, which arises from
               strain-induced spontaneous partitioning of PbTiO3 thin films
               into nearly energetically degenerate, hierarchical domain
               architectures of coexisting c/a and a1 /a2 domain structures.
               Using band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy, this study
               manipulates and acoustically detects a facile interconversion of
               different ferroelastic variants via a two-step, three-state

              chemically inert but can be functionalized with respect to the
              studied sample. This implies that basic imaging and scanning
              procedures do not affect surface and bulk chemistry of the
              studied sample. However, an in-depth study of the confined
              chemical processes taking place at the tip-surface junction and
              the associated chemical changes to the material surface have been
              missing as of now. Here, we used a hybrid system that combines
              time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry with an atomic
              force microscopy to investigate the chemical interactions that
              take place at the tip-surface junction. Investigations showed
              that even basic contact mode AFM scanning is able to modify the
              surface of the studied sample. In particular, we found that the
              silicone oils deposited from the AFM tip into the scanned regions
              and spread to distances exceeding 15 $\mu$m from the tip. These
              oils were determined to come from standard gel boxes used for the
              storage of the tips. The explored phenomena are important for
              interpreting and understanding results of AFM mechanical and
              electrical studies relying on the state of the tip-surface
              junction.",

  abstract = "A range of modern applications require large and tunable
              dielectric, piezoelectric or pyroelectric response of
              ferroelectrics. Such effects are intimately connected to the
              nature of polarization and how it responds to externally applied
              stimuli. Ferroelectric susceptibilities are, in general, strongly
              temperature dependent, diminishing rapidly as one transitions
              away from the ferroelectric phase transition (TC). In turn,
              researchers seek new routes to manipulate polarization to
              simultaneously enhance susceptibilities and broaden operational
              temperature ranges. Here, we demonstrate such a capability by
              creating composition and strain gradients in Ba1-xSrxTiO3 films
              which result in spatial polarization gradients as large as 35
              $\mu$C cm-2 across a 150 nm thick film. These polarization
              gradients allow for large dielectric permittivity with low loss
              (ɛr$\approx$775, tan $\delta$<0.05), negligible
              temperature-dependence (13\% deviation over 500 °C) and
              high-dielectric tunability (greater than 70\% across a 300 °C
              range). The role of space charges in stabilizing polarization
              gradients is also discussed.",

              functionalities crucial for a diverse range of applications. Over
              the past decade, there has been significant progress in epitaxial
              strain engineering of oxide ferroelectric thin films to control
              and enhance the nature of ferroelectric order, alter

              review aims to cover some of the most important discoveries in
              strain engineering over the past decade and highlight some of the
              new and emerging approaches for strain control of ferroelectrics.
              We discuss how these new approaches to strain engineering provide
              promising routes to control and decouple ferroelectric
              susceptibilities and create new modes of response not possible in
